# Svvy Application GDPR Compliance Status

## Overview
This document outlines the current status of GDPR compliance for the Svvy application, highlighting implemented features, gaps, and recommendations for full compliance. This assessment covers both frontend and backend components of the application.

## GDPR Requirements Assessment

### 1. Data Mapping
**Status**: ⚠️ Partial Implementation
- The application stores personal data including:
  - Authentication information (email, password)
  - Profile information (first name, last name, etc.)
  - Educational history
  - Application documents
  - Student profile information
- User data is handled through structured services:
  - Frontend: AuthServiceV2, UserService
  - Backend: Laravel User model, StudentProfile model
- Backend properly manages sensitive data:
  - Password hashing using Laravel's built-in mechanisms
  - Proper hiding of sensitive attributes (password, remember_token)
- **Gap**: No comprehensive documentation mapping all personal data flows and retention periods

### 2. Privacy Notices
**Status**: ⚠️ Incomplete
- Privacy Policy is referenced in multiple places:
  - Frontend: Registration and login screens (with TODO comments)
  - Backend: School registration page and landing page footer
- Links to privacy policy exist in both frontend and backend
- Missing implementation in both environments:
  - Frontend: TODO comments in the code indicate missing implementation
  - Backend: References to privacy routes exist but no actual controller or view implementation found
- **Required Action**: Implement complete privacy policy page with detailed information on data collection and usage

### 3. User Consent Management
**Status**: ⚠️ Partial Implementation
- Registration screen includes text: "By signing up, you agree to the Terms of Service and acknowledge you've read our Privacy Policy"
- Links to Terms of Service and Privacy Policy exist but aren't implemented
- Authentication flow captures basic consent during registration:
  - Frontend: Through UI text and checkbox
  - Backend: User registration process (AuthController) creates accounts but doesn't record consent status separately
- **Gap**: 
  - No granular consent options for different types of data processing
  - No backend storage of consent records with timestamps
  - No way for users to modify consent preferences later

### 4. Data Security Measures
**Status**: ✅ Good Implementation
- Frontend security:
  - Uses `FlutterSecureStorage` for secure token and user data storage
  - Encrypted local storage for sensitive information
  - Proper authentication flow with token management
- Backend security:
  - Laravel Sanctum for token-based API authentication
  - Password hashing using bcrypt
  - Encrypted cookies via Laravel middleware
  - Input validation using Laravel's Validator
  - Proper error handling and logging
- System-wide:
  - Password confirmation requirement during registration
  - Data transmission appears to use secure connections
  - Clear separation between authentication and data access

### 5. Data Processing Agreements
**Status**: ❌ Not Implemented
- No evidence of formalized data processing agreements with third parties
- **Required Action**: Document all third-party services and implement appropriate agreements

### 6. Data Access Rights
**Status**: ❌ Not Implemented
- No features allowing users to:
  - Export their personal data
  - Request modification of inaccurate data (though profile editing exists)
  - Delete their account and associated data
- Backend has some data export functionality but only for school administrators:
  - Export of student data as CSV/PDF
  - Export of application data as CSV/PDF
  - These exports aren't designed for GDPR compliance but for administrative purposes
- No account deletion API endpoints or controllers found
- **Required Action**: Implement user data control features

### 7. Data Breach Notification
**Status**: ❌ Not Implemented
- No documented process for handling data breaches
- No notification mechanism for users in case of a breach
- **Required Action**: Create data breach response protocol

## Recommendations for Full Compliance

### High Priority
1. **Complete Privacy Policy Implementation**
   - Develop comprehensive privacy policy content
   - Implement frontend privacy policy screen
   - Create backend privacy policy route, controller and view
   - Link from all registration and login screens (both frontend and backend)

2. **Implement User Data Control Features**
   - Add account deletion functionality:
     - Frontend: Account deletion option in profile settings
     - Backend: Create API endpoint for account deletion with proper authentication
   - Create personal data export capability:
     - Implement "Download my data" feature in user profile
     - Create API endpoint that generates a comprehensive data export in portable format
   - Enhance data modification options beyond basic profile editing

3. **Document Data Processing**
   - Create formal documentation of all personal data processing
   - Map data flows within the application
   - Document third-party data processors

### Medium Priority
4. **Enhance Consent Management**
   - Implement granular consent options
   - Add ability to withdraw consent
   - Create consent audit logs

5. **Create Data Processing Agreements**
   - Identify all third parties processing user data
   - Draft and implement appropriate agreements
   - Ensure compliance by third parties

### Ongoing Requirements
6. **Security Measures**
   - Conduct regular security audits
   - Implement data breach notification procedures
   - Maintain up-to-date security practices

7. **Staff Training**
   - Train all staff on GDPR requirements
   - Document training procedures
   - Conduct regular refresher courses

## Implementation Timeline

| Requirement | Current Status | Target Completion |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Privacy Policy Implementation | Not Implemented | Q2 2025 |
| User Data Control Features | Not Implemented | Q2 2025 |
| Data Processing Documentation | Partial | Q2 2025 |
| Enhanced Consent Management | Partial | Q3 2025 |
| Data Processing Agreements | Not Implemented | Q3 2025 |
| Security Audit Process | Good | Ongoing |
| Cookie Management | Not Implemented | Q2 2025 |
| Staff Training | Unknown | Q3 2025 |

## Conclusion
The Svvy application currently has partial GDPR compliance, with several key areas requiring implementation. The backend has solid security fundamentals through Laravel's built-in features, and the frontend properly secures sensitive data. However, both environments lack specific GDPR-focused features like comprehensive privacy policies, consent management, and data portability options.

By following the recommendations and timeline outlined above, you can achieve full compliance with GDPR regulations. The most urgent areas to address are implementing the privacy policy and adding user data control features.
